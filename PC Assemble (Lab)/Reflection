Looking back, building my own PC was quite the journey and I learned a lot from it. To start, preparation is essential. Selecting the proper components and ensuring that 
everything works together is similar to figuring out a puzzle. It made me realize how crucial it is to focus on the finer points when using technology.My understanding of 
how a computer functions has improved because to hands-on assembly. I was able to examine how each component works with the system as a whole after connecting the CPU, GPU, 
RAM, and storage. My understanding of what drives a computer has improved; it's like learning about the anatomy of a machine. I learned patience and problem-solving skills 
by handling unforeseen situations, such as cable malfunctions or compatibility concerns. Although things aren't always easy, it was satisfying to overcome those obstacles. 
I came to understand that figuring out tech is only one aspect of the process. Unexpectedly, cooperation was essential. Building with others meant that additional minds would 
be collaborating. We made the process easier and more fun by exchanging advice and insights. It's incredible how teamwork can transform an individual endeavor into a joint 
success. The finest aspect? Everything functioned when I initially turned on the computer! It was such a great feeling of accomplishment. It took more than just putting 
pieces together to build my PC; it was also an interactive lesson in technology, problem-solving, and collaboration. It has given me a whole new perspective on and 
appreciation for technology.
