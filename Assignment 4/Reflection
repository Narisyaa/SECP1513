Dr. Seah Choon Sen's I-Farm innovation is a game-changer, especially during Covid-19 pandemic. By combining technology like IoT 
with precision farming, IFarm offers a practical solution to the shortage of fresh vegetables. What's cool is that it's not 
just about getting veggies â€“ it's about making the whole process transparent and environmentally friendly. People also get fresh
and pesticide-free produce right at their doorstep, and the community becomes more self-sufficient. Thus, I-Farm goes beyond 
solving the immediate problem of vegetable shortages. It's about creating a sustainable, transparent, and efficient way of 
growing and distributing food, making life better for everyone involved.
